# 🤖 LangGraph Documentation RAG Assistant

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow designed to answer technical questions from the **LangGraph documentation** using its own text corpus. This project integrates **LangGraph** workflows, **LangChain**, **Qdrant** vector database, and **OpenAI** embeddings + GPT-4 to build a fully functional domain-specific assistant.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/langgraph_documentation_RAG
cd langgraph_documentation_RAG
```

### 2. Install Dependencies with Poetry

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry install
poetry shell
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file using the sample provided:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Then update your `.env` with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

---

## Run the RAG Pipeline

Run the `test_end_to_end.ipynb` notebook. It will include:

* Clone the official LangGraph documentation repository.
* Load and split the documentation into optimized chunks.
* Generate embeddings using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-large model.
* Store the embedded chunks into Qdrant for later retrieval.
* Build the RAG-pipeline instance.
* Create an interactive cell for chat.


### Example Queries

```text
“What is the difference between a LangGraph workflow and an agent?”

“How can I use checkpoints or memory between steps in LangGraph?”

“Explain multi-agent routing with LangGraph.”
```

## For development

This project uses **Poetry** to manage dependencies and virtual environments efficiently.

### 1. Install Poetry

Ensure you have Poetry installed:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### 2. Initialize Poetry in the Project (First-Time Setup Only)

If this is the first time setting up the project, navigate to the project folder and initialize Poetry:

```bash
cd langgraph_documentation_RAG
poetry init
```

If the project is already initialized, skip this step and proceed to dependency installation.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Add the new dependencies to the project, for example:

```bash
poetry add numpy pandas requests
```

For development dependencies, use the following:

```bash
poetry add --dev black pytest
```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment. To activate it, first make sure to have installed :

```bash
poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry shell
```

To run a script within the virtual environment without activating it:

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

### 5. Store Virtual Environment in the Project (Optional)

To keep the virtual environment inside the project folder:

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
```

This will create a `.venv/` directory inside the project.

### 6. Check the Environment Status

To view environment details:

```bash
poetry env info
```

To list installed dependencies:

```bash
poetry show
```

### 7. Reproducing the Environment on Another Machine

When cloning the project, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all dependencies as specified in `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.

### 8. Generating the requirements.txt using Poetry

Make sure the poetry-plugin-export plugin is installed. If not, you can install it with the following command:
 `poetry self add poetry-plugin-export`.

Then, export your project’s dependencies to a requirements.txt file using:

```bash
poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
```

### 9. Pre-commit Setup

Once you have installed the dependencies using `poetry install`, you will need to configure pre-commit hooks:

```python
pre-commit install
```

This command sets up the pre-commit hooks that automatically format your code according to the rules defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. The hooks are executed before each commit, and if any rule fails, the commit will be blocked. You can also run the hooks manually with:

```python
pre-commit run --all
```
