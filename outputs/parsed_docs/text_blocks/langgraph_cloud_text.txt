To deploy a [LangGraph Server](../concepts/langgraph_server.md), follow the how-to guide for [how to deploy to Cloud SaaS](../cloud/deployment/cloud.md).

The Cloud SaaS deployment option is a fully managed model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md) and [data plane](./langgraph_data_plane.md) in our cloud.
