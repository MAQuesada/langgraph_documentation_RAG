Breakpoints pause graph execution at defined points and let you step through each stage. They use LangGraph's [**persistence layer**](./persistence.md), which saves the graph state after each step.

With breakpoints, you can inspect the graph's state and node inputs at any point. Execution pauses **indefinitely** until you resume, as the checkpointer preserves the state.
