This guide assumes knowledge of what double-texting is, which you can learn about in the [double-texting conceptual guide](../../concepts/double_texting.md).

The guide covers the `reject` option for double texting, which rejects the new run of the graph by throwing an error and continues with the original run until completion. Below is a quick example of using the `reject` option.

First, we will define a quick helper function for printing out JS and CURL model outputs (you can skip this if using Python):

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Now, let's import our required packages and instantiate our client, assistant, and thread.

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Now we can run a thread and try to run a second one with the "reject" option, which should fail since we have already started a run:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

We can verify that the original thread finished executing:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:
