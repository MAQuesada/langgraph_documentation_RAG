LangGraph provides [**time travel**](../../concepts/time-travel.md) functionality to **resume execution from a prior checkpoint** â€” either replaying the same state or modifying it to explore alternatives. In all cases, resuming past execution produces a **new fork** in the history.

To use time-travel in LangGraph:
