This can be useful for long running jobs.

First let's set up our client and thread:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

If we list the current runs on this thread, we will see that it's empty:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

Now let's kick off a run:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

The first time we poll it, we can see `status=pending`:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

Now we can join the run, wait for it to finish and check that status again:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

Perfect! The run succeeded as we would expect. We can double check that the run worked as expected by printing out the final state:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

We can also just print the content of the last AIMessage:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:
