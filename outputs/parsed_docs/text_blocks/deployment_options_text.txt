There are 4 main options for deploying with the LangGraph Platform:

The [Cloud SaaS](./langgraph_cloud.md) deployment option is a fully managed model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md) and [data plane](./langgraph_data_plane.md) in our cloud. This option provides a simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph Servers.

Connect your GitHub repositories to the platform and deploy your LangGraph Servers from the [control plane UI](./langgraph_control_plane.md#control-plane-ui). The build process (i.e. CI/CD) is managed internally by the platform.

    The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option is currently in beta stage and requires an [Enterprise](../concepts/plans.md) plan.

The [Self-Hosted Data Plane](./langgraph_self_hosted_data_plane.md) deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md) in our cloud and you manage the [data plane](./langgraph_data_plane.md) in your cloud. This option provides a way to securely manage your data plane infrastructure, while offloading control plane management to us.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](./langgraph_cli.md) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](./langgraph_control_plane.md#control-plane-ui).

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (coming soon!)

    The Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option is currently in beta stage and requires an [Enterprise](../concepts/plans.md) plan.

The [Self-Hosted Control Plane](./langgraph_self_hosted_control_plane.md) deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage the [control plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md) and [data plane](./langgraph_data_plane.md) in your cloud. This option gives you full control and responsibility of the control plane and data plane infrastructure.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](./langgraph_cli.md) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](./langgraph_control_plane.md#control-plane-ui).

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

For more information, please see:

The [Standalone Container](./langgraph_standalone_container.md) deployment option is the least restrictive model for deployment. Deploy standalone instances of a LangGraph Server in your cloud, using any of the [available](./plans.md) license options.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](./langgraph_cli.md) and deploy your LangGraph Server using the container deployment tooling of your choice. Images can be deployed to any compute platform.
