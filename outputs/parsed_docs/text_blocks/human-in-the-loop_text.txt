To review, edit and approve tool calls in an agent you can use LangGraph's built-in [Human-In-the-Loop (HIL)](../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) features, specifically the [`interrupt()`][langgraph.types.interrupt] primitive.

LangGraph allows you to pause execution **indefinitely** — for minutes, hours, or even days—until human input is received.

This is possible because the agent state is **checkpointed into a database**, which allows the system to persist execution context and later resume the workflow, continuing from where it left off.

For a deeper dive into the **human-in-the-loop** concept, see the [concept guide](../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md).

To add a human approval step to a tool:

Resume the agent with a `Command(resume=...)` to continue based on human input.

You can create a wrapper to add interrupts to *any* tool.

The example below provides a reference implementation compatible with [Agent Inbox UI](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-inbox) and [Agent Chat UI](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-chat-ui).

Resume the agent with a `Command(resume=...)`  to continue based on human input.
