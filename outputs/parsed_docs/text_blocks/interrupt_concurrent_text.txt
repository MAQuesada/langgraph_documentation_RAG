This guide assumes knowledge of what double-texting is, which you can learn about in the [double-texting conceptual guide](../../concepts/double_texting.md).

The guide covers the `interrupt` option for double texting, which interrupts the prior run of the graph and starts a new one with the double-text. This option does not delete the first run, but rather keeps it in the database but sets its status to `interrupted`. Below is a quick example of using the `interrupt` option.

First, we will define a quick helper function for printing out JS and CURL model outputs (you can skip this if using Python):

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Now, let's import our required packages and instantiate our client, assistant, and thread.

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Now we can start our two runs and join the second one until it has completed:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

We can see that the thread has partial data from the first run + data from the second run

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

Verify that the original, interrupted run was interrupted

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

Output:
