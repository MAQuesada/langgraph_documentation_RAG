There are two versions of the self-hosted deployment: [Self-Hosted Data Plane](./deployment_options.md#self-hosted-data-plane) and [Self-Hosted Control Plane](./deployment_options.md#self-hosted-control-plane).

!!! info "Important"
    The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option is currently in beta stage and requires an [Enterprise](../../concepts/plans.md) plan.

The [Self-Hosted Data Plane](../cloud/deployment/self_hosted_data_plane.md) deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md) in our cloud and you manage the [data plane](./langgraph_data_plane.md) in your cloud. This option provides a way to securely manage your data plane infrastructure, while offloading control plane management to us. When using the Self-Hosted Data Plane version, you authenticate with a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) API key.

For information on how to deploy a [LangGraph Server](../concepts/langgraph_server.md) to Self-Hosted Data Plane, see [Deploy to Self-Hosted Data Plane](../cloud/deployment/self_hosted_data_plane.md)
