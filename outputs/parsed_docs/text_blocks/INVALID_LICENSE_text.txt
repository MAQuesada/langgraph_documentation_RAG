This error is raised when license verification fails while attempting to start a self-hosted LangGraph Platform server. This error is specific to the LangGraph Platform and is not related to the open source libraries.

This error occurs when running a self-hosted deployment of LangGraph Platform without a valid enterprise license or API key.

First, confirm the desired mode of deployment.

If you're just developing locally, you can use the lightweight in-memory server by running `langgraph dev`.
See the [local server](../../tutorials/langgraph-platform/local-server.md) docs for more information.

If you would like a fast managed environment, consider the [Cloud SaaS](../../concepts/langgraph_cloud.md) deployment option. This requires no additional license key.

If your deployment is unlikely to see more than 1 million node executions per year and don't need Crons and other enterprise features, consider the [Standalone Container](../../concepts/deployment_options.md) deployment option.

You can deploy with Standalone Container by setting a valid `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` in your environment (e.g., in the `.env` file referenced by `langgraph.json`) and building a Docker image. The API key must be associated with an account on a **Plus** plan or greater.

For full self-hosting, set the `LANGGRAPH_CLOUD_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. If you are interested in an enterprise license key, please contact the LangChain support team.

For more information on deployment options and their features, see the [Deployment Options](../../concepts/deployment_options.md) documentation.

If you have confirmed that you would like to self-host LangGraph Platform, please verify your credentials.
