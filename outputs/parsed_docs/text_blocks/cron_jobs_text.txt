Sometimes you don't want to run your graph based on user interaction, but rather you would like to schedule your graph to run on a schedule - for example if you wish for your graph to compose and send out a weekly email of to-dos for your team. LangGraph Platform allows you to do this without having to write your own script by using the `Crons` client. To schedule a graph job, you need to pass a [cron expression](https://crontab.cronhub.io/) to inform the client when you want to run the graph. `Cron` jobs are run in the background and do not interfere with normal invocations of the graph.

First, let's set up our SDK client, assistant, and thread:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

To create a cron job associated with a specific thread, you can write:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Note that it is **very** important to delete `Cron` jobs that are no longer useful. Otherwise you could rack up unwanted API charges to the LLM! You can delete a `Cron` job using the following code:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

You can also create stateless cron jobs by using the following code:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Again, remember to delete your job once you are done with it!

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"
