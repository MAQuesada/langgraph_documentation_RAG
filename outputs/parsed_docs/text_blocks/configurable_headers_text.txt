LangGraph allows runtime configuration to modify agent behavior and permissions dynamically. When using the [LangGraph Platform](../quick_start.md), you can pass this configuration in the request body (`config`) or specific request headers. This enables adjustments based on user identity or other request data.

For privacy, control which headers are passed to the runtime configuration via the `http.configurable_headers` section in your `langgraph.json` file.

Here's how to customize the included and excluded headers:

The `include` and `exclude` lists accept exact header names or patterns using `*` to match any number of characters. For your security, no other regex patterns are supported.

You can access the included headers in your graph using the `config` argument of any node.

Or by fetching from context (useful in tools and or within other nested functions).

You can even use this to dynamically compile the graph.

If you'd like to opt-out of configurable headers, you can simply set a wildcard pattern in the `exclude` list:

This will exclude all headers from being added to your run's configuration.

Note that exclusions take precedence over inclusions.
