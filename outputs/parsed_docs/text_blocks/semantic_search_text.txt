This guide explains how to add semantic search to your LangGraph deployment's cross-thread [store](../../concepts/persistence.md#memory-store), so that your agent can search for memories and other documents by semantic similarity.

This configuration:

Or if using requirements.txt:

Once configured, you can use semantic search in your LangGraph nodes. The store requires a namespace tuple to organize memories:

If you want to use custom embeddings, you can pass a path to a custom embedding function:

The deployment will look for the function in the specified path. The function must be async and accept a list of strings:

You can also query the store using the LangGraph SDK. Since the SDK uses async operations:
