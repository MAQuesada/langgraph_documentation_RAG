This guide assumes knowledge of what double-texting is, which you can learn about in the [double-texting conceptual guide](../../concepts/double_texting.md).

The guide covers the `enqueue` option for double texting, which adds the interruptions to a queue and executes them in the order they are received by the client. Below is a quick example of using the `enqueue` option.

First, we will define a quick helper function for printing out JS and CURL model outputs (you can skip this if using Python):

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Then, let's import our required packages and instantiate our client, assistant, and thread.

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Now let's start two runs, with the second interrupting the first one with a multitask strategy of "enqueue":

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Verify that the thread has data from both runs:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:
