Studio allows you to view threads from the server and edit their state.

To edit the state of the thread, select "edit node state" next to the desired node. Edit the node's output as desired and click "fork" to confirm. This will create a new forked run from the checkpoint of the selected node.

If you instead want to re-run the thread from a given checkpoint without editing the state, click the "Re-run from here". This will again create a new forked run from the selected checkpoint. This is useful for re-running with changes that are not specific to the state, such as the selected assistant.

To edit a human message in the thread, click the edit button below the human message. Edit the message as desired and submit. This will create a new fork of the conversation history. To re-generate an AI message, click the retry icon below the AI message.
