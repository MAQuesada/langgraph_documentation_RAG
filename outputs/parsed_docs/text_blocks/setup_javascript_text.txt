A [LangGraph.js](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) application must be configured with a [LangGraph configuration file](../reference/cli.md#configuration-file) in order to be deployed to LangGraph Platform (or to be self-hosted). This how-to guide discusses the basic steps to setup a LangGraph.js application for deployment using `package.json` to specify project dependencies.

This walkthrough is based on [this repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs-studio-starter), which you can play around with to learn more about how to setup your LangGraph application for deployment.

The final repository structure will look something like this:

After each step, an example file directory is provided to demonstrate how code can be organized.

Dependencies can be specified in a `package.json`. If none of these files is created, then dependencies can be specified later in the [LangGraph configuration file](#create-langgraph-api-config).

Example `package.json` file:

When deploying your app, the dependencies will be installed using the package manager of your choice, provided they adhere to the compatible version ranges listed below:

Example file directory:

Environment variables can optionally be specified in a file (e.g. `.env`). See the [Environment Variables reference](../reference/env_var.md) to configure additional variables for a deployment.

Example `.env` file:

Example file directory:

Implement your graphs! Graphs can be defined in a single file or multiple files. Make note of the variable names of each compiled graph to be included in the LangGraph application. The variable names will be used later when creating the [LangGraph configuration file](../reference/cli.md#configuration-file).

Here is an example `agent.ts`:

Example file directory:

Create a [LangGraph configuration file](../reference/cli.md#configuration-file) called `langgraph.json`. See the [LangGraph configuration file reference](../reference/cli.md#configuration-file) for detailed explanations of each key in the JSON object of the configuration file.

Example `langgraph.json` file:

Note that the variable name of the `CompiledGraph` appears at the end of the value of each subkey in the top-level `graphs` key (i.e. `:<variable_name>`).

After you setup your project and place it in a GitHub repository, it's time to [deploy your app](./cloud.md).
