LangGraph supports robust **human-in-the-loop (HIL)** workflows, enabling human intervention at any point in an automated process. This is especially useful in large language model (LLM)-driven applications where model output may require validation, correction, or additional context.

Please see [the overview of LangGraph human-in-the-loop](../../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) features for more information.

The [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] in LangGraph enables human-in-the-loop workflows by pausing the graph at a specific node, presenting information to a human, and resuming the graph with their input. It's useful for tasks like approvals, edits, or gathering additional context.

The graph is resumed using a [`Command`][langgraph.types.Command] object that provides the human's response.

**Graph node with `interrupt`:**

=== "cURL"
