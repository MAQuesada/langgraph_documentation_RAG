In LangGraph Platform, a thread is not explicitly associated with a particular agent.
This means that you can run multiple agents on the same thread, which allows a different agent to continue from an initial agent's progress.

In this example, we will create two agents and then call them both on the same thread.
You'll see that the second agent will respond using information from the [checkpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#checkpointer-state) generated in the thread by the first agent as context.

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

We can see that these agents are different:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

We can now run the OpenAI assistant on the thread first.

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:

Now, we can run it on the default assistant and see that this second assistant is aware of the initial question, and can answer the question, "and you?":

=== "Python"

=== "Javascript"

=== "CURL"

Output:
