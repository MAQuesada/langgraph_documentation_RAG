??? info "Missing Local Package?"
    If you are not using `uv` and run into a "`ModuleNotFoundError`" or "`ImportError`", even after installing the local package (`pip install -e .`), it is likely the case that you need to install the CLI into your local virtual environment to make the CLI "aware" of the local package. You can do this by running `python -m pip install "langgraph-cli[inmem]"` and re-activating your virtual environment before running `langgraph dev`.
