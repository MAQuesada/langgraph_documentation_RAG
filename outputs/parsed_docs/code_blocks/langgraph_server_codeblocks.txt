We often think of a graph as implementing an [agent](agentic_concepts.md), but a graph does not necessarily need to implement an agent. For example, a graph could implement a simple
chatbot that only supports back-and-forth conversation, without the ability to influence any application control flow. In reality, as applications get more complex, a graph will often implement a more complex flow that may use [multiple agents](./multi_agent.md) working in tandem.
