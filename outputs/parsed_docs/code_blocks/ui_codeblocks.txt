UI has out-of-box support for rendering tool calls, and tool result messages. To customize what messages are shown, see the [Hiding Messages in the Chat](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-chat-ui?tab=readme-ov-file#hiding-messages-in-the-chat) section in the Agent Chat UI documentation.

Agent Chat UI works best if your LangGraph agent interrupts using the [`HumanInterrupt` schema][langgraph.prebuilt.interrupt.HumanInterrupt]. If you do not use that schema, the Agent Chat UI will be able to render the input passed to the `interrupt` function, but it will not have full support for resuming your graph.
